# Ecommerce_Project

By combining HTML for structure, CSS for design, and JavaScript for interactivity, I aimed to craft an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly platform. This project allowed me to showcase my creativity, technical expertise, and problem-solving abilities. 
I have also used media query to make this project responsive for desktops, big and small phones.
